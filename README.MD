**Khusbu Choudhary** is a financial consultant and She help individuals and families in planning their finances systematically so that they can fulfill all their financial Goals.

In these 100 days, she will start with basics of #personalfinance - the concepts if you knew at start of your career would have changed your current financial status.

I am **Prashant**, documenting her precious words.

## Day 1

**Topic** - What you think about Money?

When I started my career with Citibank, a very senior colleague suggested me to read some good books on Money Mindset before I start managing my own money. I read 3 books - (there are many you can choose)

1. Rich Dad Poor Dad - Robert Kiyosaki
2. Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant - Robert Kiyosaki
3. Secrets of the Millionaire Mind - T. Harv Eker

The one point highlighted by these authors was - The way you think about money, you become the same.

Your Money Mindset starts building from your early childhood; how your parents thought, felt and behaved in financial matters at home, the same was programmed in your mind too. Infact, Kids were never taught about Money neither at home nor in school/colleges; women of the families were never involved in the financial matters; a few specific communities behaves differently in money related matters.

These are nothing but self limiting beliefs which stops people from exploring beyond their existing beliefs and mindsets.

Ask yourself - How I think about Money?
Money doesn’t grow on trees
Money can't buy happiness
Earning Money is not easy
Money makes people arrogant

If dealing in Money makes you uncomfortable, stressful, doubtful, or any negative sentiment, you certainly need to change your Money Mindset before you plan how to manage Money.



## Day 2

**Topic** - How to Think About Money ?

First of all, understand that Wealth does not mean having a fat bank balance. Wealth is primarily the ability to create wealth.

Example 1: Someone who wins the lottery or gambling. Even if he wins 100 millions might not be a rich man. He is just a poor man with a lot of money. That's the reason why 90% of the lottery millionaires become poor again after 5 years. (It is a fact)

Example 2: Most Successful People
They are already on the road to wealth even though they have no money, because they are developing their financial intelligence and that is wealth.

How are the rich and the poor (mindset) different?

If you see a person who decides to learn and explore new things, who tries to improve himself/herself constantly, who always thinks of progress and growth opportunities, who has a positive thoughts and feelings while dealing in money matters.

know that- he/she is a rich person having a positive money mindset

If you see a person who thinks that -
-The money doesn't grow on trees (Thinks money as a scarce resource)
-Money can't buy happiness (Thinks money in term of to buy stuffs or meet expenses or pay bills only)
-Earning money is not easy (Thinks money as an earning exchanged for time and energy given to a work)
-Money makes people arrogant (Thinks money as a means to show off others)

Know that - he/she is a poor person with negative thoughts and feelings when dealing in money which will stop them to build wealth.

Wealth is first of all a state of mind.

Think of Money as a tool - which gives you a freedom to choose, to live your life the way you want, take out time to do things you love and be with people who are precious to you. If you are able to do all this, You are Wealthy!

Are you Poor or Rich?



## Day 3

**Topic** -Why Setting Financial Goals Is important?

What is Financial Goal ?
Any need, want or dreams which need money to fulfill it, is a financial goal.

For Example-
Building an emergency fund of 6 months of my income in 1 year
Buying a car worth 50lacs in 5 years
Buying a home worth 1 crore in 10 years
Saving 50 lacs for my kids education required after 15 yeas
Saving 5 crores for my own Retirement

When you set up your financial goals, you'll start to see how every decision you make affects your greater financial health.

Example:
Let say you have not set your financial goals yet. You like drinking coffee and buy one Coffee every day. Sure, you could make coffee at home or get it at work, but somehow you like buying it from your favorite coffee shop (You can choose any such examples from your life)

Now lets do the Math -
One mug of coffee cost you - 200 rupees
One Month - 6000 rupees

What else could you do with that money?

You put 5000 rupees in an investment account every month for 5 years (assuming some days you will drink coffee too :P )
Your coffee fund could grow into - over 4 Lacs

That could be a fund for your International Vacation or some other short term Goal!

Imagine if you remained invested for 15 years -
Your coffee fund could grow into - Over 25 lacs

"That could fund your Kids education or down payment of your house"

And if you remained invested for 30 years?
Your coffee money could grow into - over 1.75 crores

"That could partially fund your retirement"

Point is clear: When you set your Financial Goals, it helps you take CONSCIOUS Money Decisions; it doesn't mean you stop spending money on your wants, it simply means if needed you sacrifice few of your wants NOW so that you can fulfill your bigger Goals later.
It's like making a choice-

A Coffee a day or Crores of Savings??

\* I assumed ROI of 12% for the above example.

Enjoying my coffee at home :)



## Day 4

**Topic** -Why Saving Is important

People in their 20s -

1. They Save for short term needs;
2. They don't plan for long term goals especially Retirement
3. Their priority is to enjoy life more as 20's is a peak time to do certain things.

Many people at later stages are not able to "save regularly" because -

1. They have more financial needs to take care
2.  They have EMIs to pay
3. They didn't do financial planning

Savings is not just about accumulating fund so that you can spend for certain needs in future. It's beyond that -

Imagine -

1. If you have 2 days of expenses in your bank, you can go for a short trip without worrying about a salary cut. 
2.  A few months of expenses means you can look for a new job if you lose your current one. 
3.  A year of expenses means you can take a break to go for further studies or start your own business.
4.  With 15 years of expenses, you can leave your job and do what you like even if it doesn't pay much. (For me I want to travel blog)
5.  30 years of expenses gives you the ability to stop working altogether.

Saving = Freedom
And, Freedom brings choices. 
And Choices make us happy and ultimately spend time doing things what we love.

Therefore, more savings=more freedom=more choices!

Did you think like that?



## Day 5

**Topic** - How should I begin my financial journey?

When you start earning, the first thing comes into mind is meeting your current expenses and saving for future Financial Goals. But, before you start working on your Financial Goals, its very important to take care of three most important uncertainties of your life -

1) Life Loss - Life is uncertain and if you have anyone who depends on your income then you certainly need a Life cover to provide for them in case you pass away prematurely. Even if you are single, get yourself insured while your premiums are low. 
2)  Health Loss - Today the cost of healthcare has risen significantly and any major treatment can cause a significant dent in your wallet. Also, the ongoing pandemic has affected people's health badly and therefore, getting a health insurance cover for yourself and your family can provide the added protection you need in times like these. 
3) Income loss - Build an Emergency Fund for any financial shocks like a sudden job loss, sudden medical challenges, home repairs due to a natural disaster, unanticipated vehicle repairs or any sort of contingency. You might not face financial emergencies every year. They come infrequently but can dent your finances in such a way that it would take years to recover. For many, the covid-19 pandemic is one such event.

Have you taken care of these uncertainties?

Once you plan this, you will feel much safer and at peace.



## Day 6

**Topic** - How to build #EmergencyFund(EF) ?

What is an emergency fund? It is a reserve that’s specifically set aside for unplanned expenses or financial emergencies. Some common examples include medical bills, or a loss of income, natural disaster, car repairs, home repairs, etc. The idea is you keep this fund so that you don't have to take last-minute loans, overutilize your credit card, or sell your existing assets or investments.

How much? The rule of thumb is to save at least 6 months of your salary in case you lose your job or any other unexpected expense occurs. And, the same becomes 12 months for self employed people because their work is more volatile.

Where to park - Park it in any high-interest savings accounts or any Liquid Fund.

Lets take an example -

A 22 year old started his first job with a salary of 30K. His monthly expenses is 20k. As per the rule, he should have an emergency fund of minimum 1.8 lacs (assuming 6 months of salary)

1. If he saves entire 10k every month - It will take him 18 months to build a fund.
2. If he spends 50% in his wants, 50% into his EF - It will take 36 months to build EF (assuming he is contributing same amount to EF)

At the same time he also needs to build Fund for his future goals as well? What should he do now?

1. Invest all the savings into #FutureGoals and when needed withdraw from the account?
2.  First build an Emergency Fund and then start building for Future Goals?
3. Invest for both Emergency Fund and Future Goals simultaneously?

What have you done?



## Day 7

**Topic** - Do I need a #Lifeinsurance Cover?

To make it simple - If somebody depends on your income, you need to take a life insurance cover so that for God sake something happens to you, your dependents doesn't suffer financially at least.

Question comes to mind-
I am single and have no dependents, Why should I buy insurance?

For 2 reasons -

1. You might not have dependents today, but what about tomorrow? 
2.  Premiums rise with age - you can get a bigger cover for a low premium when you are young.

Another question pops up -
Why can't I save this money? If I invest in Equity, I will be able to build a bigger corpus than invest in an Insurance product?

Answer -
Insurance is NOT an Investment product, It is a 'protection' for Life loss.
There are endowment policies which are investment + protection but the main objective of insurance is to 'protect' your dependents financially from Life loss.

Let say -
I can build a 5 crore portfolio in 20 years which is sufficient for me and my family to take care of our basic expenses and wants post my retirement.

Problem will arise when I die before that, my family would be left without an income and sufficient asset to meet our expenses. So to tackle the most uncertain aspect of life, one should get insured.

You never know if you will meet an untimely death tomorrow or live a long life till 80 or 90 or even beyond that.

Life cover is important! Don't Delay, Plan Today!



## Day 8

**Topic** -How much Life Insurance cover do I need?

There is no specific life insurance coverage fit for all individuals. Each individual has different financial background and financial needs and the cover will depend on that. You need to look at various factors like your income, expenses, current assets and liabilities, future financial goals like education expenses of your kids, Marriage, Retirement etc

Since I have been engaged into insurance planning and review for my clients for quite sometime, I found that most of them have taken a wrong cover -

1. Some of them are under covered meaning they have taken less coverage as per their requirement, and as a result they have to increase their coverage now at a high cost.
2.  Few of them have taken more than required simply because they had more cash to put in.

Why these things happen?

1. People take a lumpsum amount as a coverage depending on their premium paying capacities.
2.  People don't follow any specific calculation in term of loss of income, outstanding debt and future goals.
3.  Lack of knowledge about their needs as well as the product offering
4.  People don't consult any financial advisor before taking a policy.

Don't do these mistakes when you buy a policy. It is one of the crucial decision of your entire financial planning. One wrong call will cost you immense at later stage of your life.

How did you choose the Sum Assured amount of your policy?
