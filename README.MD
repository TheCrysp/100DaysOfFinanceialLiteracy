# 100 days of Financial Literacy

**Khusbu Choudhary** is a financial consultant and She help individuals and families in planning their finances systematically so that they can fulfill all their financial Goals.

In these 100 days, she will start with basics of #personalfinance - the concepts if you knew at start of your career would have changed your current financial status.

I am **Prashant**, documenting her precious words.

## Day 1

**Topic** - What you think about Money?

When I started my career with Citibank, a very senior colleague suggested me to read some good books on Money Mindset before I start managing my own money. I read 3 books - (there are many you can choose)

1. Rich Dad Poor Dad - Robert Kiyosaki
2. Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant - Robert Kiyosaki
3. Secrets of the Millionaire Mind - T. Harv Eker

The one point highlighted by these authors was - The way you think about money, you become the same.

Your Money Mindset starts building from your early childhood; how your parents thought, felt and behaved in financial matters at home, the same was programmed in your mind too. In fact, Kids were never taught about Money neither at home nor in school/colleges; women of the families were never involved in the financial matters; a few specific communities behaves differently in money related matters.

These are nothing but self limiting beliefs which stops people from exploring beyond their existing beliefs and mindsets.

Ask yourself - How I think about Money?
Money doesn’t grow on trees
Money can't buy happiness
Earning Money is not easy
Money makes people arrogant

If dealing in Money makes you uncomfortable, stressful, doubtful, or any negative sentiment, you certainly need to change your Money Mindset before you plan how to manage Money.



## Day 2

**Topic** - How to Think About Money ?

First of all, understand that Wealth does not mean having a fat bank balance. Wealth is primarily the ability to create wealth.

Example 1: Someone who wins the lottery or gambling. Even if he wins 100 millions might not be a rich man. He is just a poor man with a lot of money. That's the reason why 90% of the lottery millionaires become poor again after 5 years. (It is a fact)

Example 2: Most Successful People
They are already on the road to wealth even though they have no money, because they are developing their financial intelligence and that is wealth.

How are the rich and the poor (mindset) different?

If you see a person who decides to learn and explore new things, who tries to improve himself/herself constantly, who always thinks of progress and growth opportunities, who has a positive thoughts and feelings while dealing in money matters.

know that- he/she is a rich person having a positive money mindset

If you see a person who thinks that -
-The money doesn't grow on trees (Thinks money as a scarce resource)
-Money can't buy happiness (Thinks money in term of to buy stuffs or meet expenses or pay bills only)
-Earning money is not easy (Thinks money as an earning exchanged for time and energy given to a work)
-Money makes people arrogant (Thinks money as a means to show off others)

Know that - he/she is a poor person with negative thoughts and feelings when dealing in money which will stop them to build wealth.

Wealth is first of all a state of mind.

Think of Money as a tool - which gives you a freedom to choose, to live your life the way you want, take out time to do things you love and be with people who are precious to you. If you are able to do all this, You are Wealthy!

Are you Poor or Rich?



## Day 3

**Topic** -Why Setting Financial Goals Is important?

What is Financial Goal ?
Any need, want or dreams which need money to fulfill it, is a financial goal.

For Example-
Building an emergency fund of 6 months of my income in 1 year
Buying a car worth 50lacs in 5 years
Buying a home worth 1 crore in 10 years
Saving 50 lacs for my kids education required after 15 yeas
Saving 5 crores for my own Retirement

When you set up your financial goals, you'll start to see how every decision you make affects your greater financial health.

Example:
Let say you have not set your financial goals yet. You like drinking coffee and buy one Coffee every day. Sure, you could make coffee at home or get it at work, but somehow you like buying it from your favorite coffee shop (You can choose any such examples from your life)

Now lets do the Math -
One mug of coffee cost you - 200 rupees
One Month - 6000 rupees

What else could you do with that money?

You put 5000 rupees in an investment account every month for 5 years (assuming some days you will drink coffee too :P )
Your coffee fund could grow into - over 4 Lacs

That could be a fund for your International Vacation or some other short term Goal!

Imagine if you remained invested for 15 years -
Your coffee fund could grow into - Over 25 lacs

"That could fund your Kids education or down payment of your house"

And if you remained invested for 30 years?
Your coffee money could grow into - over 1.75 crores

"That could partially fund your retirement"

Point is clear: When you set your Financial Goals, it helps you take CONSCIOUS Money Decisions; it doesn't mean you stop spending money on your wants, it simply means if needed you sacrifice few of your wants NOW so that you can fulfill your bigger Goals later.
It's like making a choice-

A Coffee a day or Crores of Savings??

\* I assumed ROI of 12% for the above example.

Enjoying my coffee at home :)



## Day 4

**Topic** -Why Saving Is important

People in their 20s -

1. They Save for short term needs;
2. They don't plan for long term goals especially Retirement
3. Their priority is to enjoy life more as 20's is a peak time to do certain things.

Many people at later stages are not able to "save regularly" because -

1. They have more financial needs to take care
2. They have EMIs to pay
3. They didn't do financial planning

Savings is not just about accumulating fund so that you can spend for certain needs in future. It's beyond that -

Imagine -

1. If you have 2 days of expenses in your bank, you can go for a short trip without worrying about a salary cut. 
2. A few months of expenses means you can look for a new job if you lose your current one. 
3. A year of expenses means you can take a break to go for further studies or start your own business.
4. With 15 years of expenses, you can leave your job and do what you like even if it doesn't pay much. (For me I want to travel blog)
5. 30 years of expenses gives you the ability to stop working altogether.

Saving = Freedom
And, Freedom brings choices. 
And Choices make us happy and ultimately spend time doing things what we love.

Therefore, more savings=more freedom=more choices!

Did you think like that?



## Day 5

**Topic** - How should I begin my financial journey?

When you start earning, the first thing comes into mind is meeting your current expenses and saving for future Financial Goals. But, before you start working on your Financial Goals, its very important to take care of three most important uncertainties of your life -

1) Life Loss - Life is uncertain and if you have anyone who depends on your income then you certainly need a Life cover to provide for them in case you pass away prematurely. Even if you are single, get yourself insured while your premiums are low. 
2) Health Loss - Today the cost of healthcare has risen significantly and any major treatment can cause a significant dent in your wallet. Also, the ongoing pandemic has affected people's health badly and therefore, getting a health insurance cover for yourself and your family can provide the added protection you need in times like these. 
3) Income loss - Build an Emergency Fund for any financial shocks like a sudden job loss, sudden medical challenges, home repairs due to a natural disaster, unanticipated vehicle repairs or any sort of contingency. You might not face financial emergencies every year. They come infrequently but can dent your finances in such a way that it would take years to recover. For many, the covid-19 pandemic is one such event.

Have you taken care of these uncertainties?

Once you plan this, you will feel much safer and at peace.



## Day 6

**Topic** - How to build [#EmergencyFund](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=emergencyfund&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6864779302123159552) (EF) ?

What is an emergency fund? It is a reserve that’s specifically set aside for unplanned expenses or financial emergencies. Some common examples include medical bills, or a loss of income, natural disaster, car repairs, home repairs, etc. The idea is you keep this fund so that you don't have to take last-minute loans, overutilize your credit card, or sell your existing assets or investments.

How much? The rule of thumb is to save at least 6 months of your salary in case you lose your job or any other unexpected expense occurs. And, the same becomes 12 months for self employed people because their work is more volatile.

Where to park - Park it in any high-interest savings accounts or any Liquid Fund.

Lets take an example -

A 22 year old started his first job with a salary of 30K. His monthly expenses is 20k. As per the rule, he should have an emergency fund of minimum 1.8 lacs (assuming 6 months of salary)

1. If he saves entire 10k every month - It will take him 18 months to build a fund.
2. If he spends 50% in his wants, 50% into his EF - It will take 36 months to build EF (assuming he is contributing same amount to EF)

At the same time he also needs to build Fund for his future goals as well? What should he do now?

1. Invest all the savings into [#FutureGoals](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=futuregoals&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6864779302123159552) and when needed withdraw from the account?
2. First build an Emergency Fund and then start building for Future Goals?
3. Invest for both Emergency Fund and Future Goals simultaneously?

What have you done?



## Day 7

**Topic** - Do I need a #Lifeinsurance Cover?

To make it simple - If somebody depends on your income, you need to take a life insurance cover so that for God sake something happens to you, your dependents doesn't suffer financially at least.

Question comes to mind-
I am single and have no dependents, Why should I buy insurance?

For 2 reasons -

1. You might not have dependents today, but what about tomorrow? 
2. Premiums rise with age - you can get a bigger cover for a low premium when you are young.

Another question pops up -
Why can't I save this money? If I invest in Equity, I will be able to build a bigger corpus than invest in an Insurance product?

Answer -
Insurance is NOT an Investment product, It is a 'protection' for Life loss.
There are endowment policies which are investment + protection but the main objective of insurance is to 'protect' your dependents financially from Life loss.

Let say -
I can build a 5 crore portfolio in 20 years which is sufficient for me and my family to take care of our basic expenses and wants post my retirement.

Problem will arise when I die before that, my family would be left without an income and sufficient asset to meet our expenses. So to tackle the most uncertain aspect of life, one should get insured.

You never know if you will meet an untimely death tomorrow or live a long life till 80 or 90 or even beyond that.

Life cover is important! Don't Delay, Plan Today!



## Day 8

**Topic** -How much Life Insurance cover do I need?

There is no specific life insurance coverage fit for all individuals. Each individual has different financial background and financial needs and the cover will depend on that. You need to look at various factors like your income, expenses, current assets and liabilities, future financial goals like education expenses of your kids, Marriage, Retirement etc

Since I have been engaged into insurance planning and review for my clients for quite sometime, I found that most of them have taken a wrong cover -

1. Some of them are under covered meaning they have taken less coverage as per their requirement, and as a result they have to increase their coverage now at a high cost.
2. Few of them have taken more than required simply because they had more cash to put in.

Why these things happen?

1. People take a lumpsum amount as a coverage depending on their premium paying capacities.
2. People don't follow any specific calculation in term of loss of income, outstanding debt and future goals.
3. Lack of knowledge about their needs as well as the product offering
4. People don't consult any financial advisor before taking a policy.

Don't do these mistakes when you buy a policy. It is one of the crucial decision of your entire financial planning. One wrong call will cost you immense at later stage of your life.

How did you choose the Sum Assured amount of your policy?



## Day 9

Topic -How Long Do I Need Life Insurance Coverage?

Life insurance is taken to provide financial security to your loved ones in the event of your death. 

While doing financial planning, I review existing policies and I found these very common mistakes -

1. Many policies had a term like 10 years, 15 years, 20 years etc. which has no specific linkage with the need.
2.  Most of the policies matured at an age of 40-50 years, because of which they had to buy a new policy for a term of 10-15 years at a very higher premium.

When choosing the cover of the policy, below Key points should be considered -

1. Your life insurance policy should last as long as your financial obligations and outstanding debts are completely taken care. For example if you have any ongoing loans like home loan, business loan etc
2.  If you are taking a life protection to fulfill your financial goals, make sure the cover last till that time for example - your kids education, your own retirement, financial security to your spouse etc
3.  If you don’t purchase a sufficient term length policy now, then the premium will become very expensive at later stage.

Don't make mistakes while buying insurance, because you can't change the term period of the policies later. Also, you might have to buy another policy at maturity of your old policy and pay huge premiums.



## Day 10

**Topic** - Why Do I Need Health Insurance?

Health insurance covers the whole or a part of the risk of a person incurring medical expenses. It covers various charges pertaining to pre-hospitalization charges, post-hospitalization charges, day care, in some plans OPD charges too.

With increasing lifestyle diseases and sky rocketing medical costs, it becomes very imperative to have a health cover for entire family.

However, many youngsters in their 20s and many health conscious people don't feel the need to take a health cover simply because
a) They don't have an existing illness and
b) They don't go for frequent doctor visits also

But after Covid 19, people have become more conscious about medical emergencies and how it can attack anyone, anytime and impact them both emotionally and financially.

As a financial advisor, I always suggest that it is prudent for you to buy a health plan early in life -

1. Buy as early as possible to book the policy at the lowest possible premium else you will end up paying hefty premiums later.
2.  Buying health insurance at a young age ensures there is no scope for preexisting diseases as you will be covered early, and any diseases diagnosed later will be covered automatically.
3.  When you buy a health plan, there is a clause of waiting periods for certain surgeries, special treatments, pre-existing illness coverage, etc. If you buy early, chances are the requisite waiting periods will be over and you will be able to claim all full benefits later.

There are many other benefits of having a health Insurance cover, but the main objective is that the moment you get heavy medical bills, it doesn't wipe out your years of savings and investments.

If you have yet not taken a cover, Don't delay - Plan today!



## Day 11

**Topic** - Is corporate health insurance enough to cover your family?

Many companies provide health insurance cover to its employees and their families under their corporate health insurance plan.

The crucial Question is - "Is it enough to cover your family's health or do you need another health insurance policy?”

1) Corporate health insurances has standardized Sum Insured for all employees and their families. However, your needs might differ from the other employees. The right Sum Insured should ideally be based on your age, life stage, family structure, lifestyle, medical history, etc.

Example - Your cover provided by the company is 2 lacs which covers Employee+spouse+2 kids.

1. What about your parents who are dependent on you?
2.  What if you have more than 2 kids?
3.  What if one of your kid is say more than 18years and as a policy not covered under the plan.
4. What if someone in your family suffers from a Critical Illness and the treatment cost shoots up to more than 5 lakhs or say 10 lakhs.

2) Corporate health insurance policy lasts till you are employed. When you leave your job, your corporate health insurance cover ceases to exist immediately. 

Important is to have a sufficient cover for yourself and your entire family so that at the time of medical emergencies, your saving and investments are not wiped out.

If your corporate cover is not sufficient, have a separate top up plan so that you are not under insured.

\3) Take an independent critical illnesses cover that offers protection against dreaded illnesses, such as cancer, stroke, kidney disease etc. For instance, if you take a policy for 10 lakh, you will get a lump-sum benefit equal to sum insured if you are diagnosed of such diseases; treatment of which is normally for a long term and very costly.

Will talk about Critical Illness in detail in next post. Stay tuned!



## Day 12

**Topic** - What to check in a #healthinsurance policy?

I am sharing below checklist you should see before subscribing to a health insurance policy -

1. opt for pre and post-hospitalization care - You might have to go through a host of diagnostic tests before you’re hospitalized. Once you’re discharged you’ll have to worry about medication. And these costs can add up. So it’s always best to pick a policy that covers pre & post-hospitalization care.
2.  Coverage for daycare treatments - some treatments might last less than 24 hours for example - chemotherapy, dialysis, a quick appendectomy etc. Check your plan provides daycare treatments.
3. Seek a Low Waiting Period - If you have any pre-existing diseases (like Diabetes, BP, Thyroid etc), then you have to wait a fixed period before your insurer starts covering claims arising out of these complications. Typically anywhere between 2 to 4 years. So it’s always best to pick a policy with lesser waiting period.
4. Check for Disease Wise Sub-limits - Insurer offers you a massive cover (say 10 lakhs) for a modest fee, only to include restrictions on how much of this cover will be available for each disease. So, in effect, you’ll likely end up having only a part of the 10 lakhs available in most cases. Avoid that.
5. Avoid co-payment clause - In this case you’ll be required to pay part of the expenses incurred (depending on the payment clause whether it is 10% or 20% or even more.)
6. Cover for Alternative treatments - If you consulting alternate medicines like Ayurveda, Acupuncture, Homeopathy etc, you might want to check if your insurer covers these treatment options as well.
7. Free Health Checkups every year - If you are looking to make sure you’re always in good health and conduct regular health checkups, then this clause might come in handy.

There are many other features and clauses; so one should carefully check all of these before getting a health insurance. If your corporate plan or existing policy doesn't fulfill some of your needs then you should opt for a new policy with all the features and benefits.



## Day 3

**Topic** - Do I need a cover for Critical Illness?
     
What is Critical Illness cover?
A critical illness plan is a policy that pays the insured a lump sum following the diagnosis of an illness covered under the plan. It covers a list of diseases like cancer, organ transplant, heart attack, stroke, renal failure, and paralysis among others. However, the list might vary from company to company.

When you subscribe to Life Insurance policy, some plans provide the option to include Critical Illness as a rider. Else you can also take a separate Critical Illness cover.

Many people assume they’re fully protected with a standard health insurance plan, but the exorbitant costs of treating life-threatening illnesses are usually more than any plan will cover.

Points to consider-

1. Critical illness insurance will provide you 'additional' cover for medical emergencies like heart attacks, strokes, or cancer etc.
2.  Treatments for critical illnesses usually cost more than regular treatments. Therefore, a standard health plan may not be enough in such a case.
3.  Once the illness is confirmed, the insured will receive a 'lump sum' to cover those costs as compared to regular health plans where you will be required to have hospitalization to recover the incurred cost. 
   When you receive lump sum, you can use the money for non medical cost as well.

Critical illnesses cost way more than regular conditions and lead to increased medication, doctor visits, consultations, which may not be covered by your normal health cover. So it is very important to have a critical illness cover as well.

Do you have a critical illness cover?



## Day 14

**Topic** -Should I add riders to my basic Insurance Plan?

Riders are 'additional benefits' that can be bought and added to a basic life insurance policy. These are designed to meet specific needs ranging from accidental death/ disability, critical illness, waiver of premium etc. In general, the extra premium paid for a rider is low because relatively little underwriting is required.

Some Useful riders -

1. Accidental Death Benefit - Under this rider benefit, in case of death by accident a sum equal to the basic sum assured is paid to the nominee over and above the sum assured under the policy.
2. Accidental Disability rider -A disability rider is a beneficial cover in case the insured suffers from a total, partial or permanent disability due to an accident. Depending on the policy, this rider either pays a lump sum benefit or an income benefit payable to the insured and their family in case of disability.
3.  Critical Illness Rider - Under this rider, the insured receives a lump-sum on the diagnosis of critical illness pre-specified in the policy.
4.  Premium Waiver Rider - This rider keeps your policy from lapsing if you become disabled (or die in case of child policy) and can no longer pay your premiums. 

Whether you should buy life insurance riders and which riders are right for you largely depends on your specific financial and personal situation.

Once you have selected a suitable base plan, select an appropriate rider for your specific needs and add value to your policy. Make sure to understand and evaluate your needs before making the final purchase.



## Day 15

**Topic** -Can a Salaried person get rich through salary income?

What does it mean to be rich? The answer will vary from person to person. For some people, being rich means the ability to buy whatever they want. For others, it might mean living without debt. And to some people, being rich might have nothing to do with money at all. 

For me - Being rich means living the life of financial freedom, doing things I love without thinking about money. It doesn't mean having lots of money - it's about knowing when and how to spend it. 

One of the biggest hinderance in being rich is people think that they earn a fixed income and so they can never be rich. Let me share a good news -
"Being rich is not a function of how much you get daily or monthly, It is by your ability to manage your finances and save & Invest regularly"

I know personally some low-income earners -peons, drivers, cooks of companies who have built houses before the CEOs of the company.

So as an employee, you can achieve a lot regardless of your income if you can apply the necessary financial skills to manage your finances and also create wealth with your salary income.  



## Day 16

**Topic** - Know your #Networth

Till now I have talked about #MoneyMindset, #financialgoals setting, #Savings, Importance to have #Insurance both #lifeinsurance and #healthinsurance, #emergencyfund

I expect all of you who have started your financial journey with me has taken care of below three most important things -

1. Building an Emergency Fund
2.  Protected your family against life uncertainties - Life Insurance
3.  Protecting your family against medical emergencies - Health Insurance

Now comes the most important task is to evaluate your current financial situation i.e., your current Net Worth. Net worth is the difference between what you own and what you owe. 

Key points -

1. Net Worth = Total Assets - Total Liabilities.
   If the figure is negative, it means you owe more than you own. If the number is positive, you own more than you owe.
2.  Assets include investments, bank accounts, real estate, and personal items like your car or jewelry etc
   Liabilities include your outstanding loans, credit card debt, Outstanding expenses etc.
3.  Knowing your net worth is the first step to evaluate your current financial status and plan for the future. As you grow in life, your net worth ideally should also grow.



Do you know your current Net Worth?



## Day 17

**Topic** - Why knowing your #Networth is important

3 Reasons You Need to Know Your Net Worth -

1.Your Net Worth Shows Where You Are!

- Are you saving enough for retirement?
- Do you have money in your savings account to cover an emergency?
- How much loans do you need to pay off?

2. Your Net Worth Shows What Needs to Be Fixed!
   - if you have high debt in your books, you can plan to reduce it to ZERO
   -  if you have very less liquid assets, you can plan to increase it

3. Your Net Worth Shows further course of Action!
   It gives you a reference point for measuring progress toward your financial goals.
   - How much corpus is created for various goals
   - How much further is required
   - Are you in track or off track and accordingly make changes.

Have you created your Personal Net Worth? What does it tell you ?
